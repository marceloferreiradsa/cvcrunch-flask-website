Other Activities
Coloring books – With the aim of combating religious intolerance and promoting knowledge, I am producing coloring books for both adult and child audiences featuring Yoruba religion, with the main characters being the Orishas. Recognizing that coloring books are a widely used stress-relief resource, I realized they could also provide an opportunity for children and adults to engage with the deities of these religions. The illustrations are being developed with the assistance of AI, with enhancements made in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. The expected release date is the second half of 2024.
